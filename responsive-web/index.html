                 <h2>The Winters Legacy</h2>
                 <p>Winters Automotive is a family owned business, owned by my grandfather. He began autobody work at just 15 years old many years ago. Him and my uncle now run the shop together in Bryant, Alabama. Together, they restore cars, rolbacks, and more. Just this past weekend, my uncle officially opened his drift track on the property for the first test day as well.</p>

    <h4>More Background on the Owner</h4>
    <p>Like I said, the owner is my grandfather. Michael Winters has been working on cars for nearly five decdes, even when he had full time jobs before operating his own business. Many of his current customers have followed him from shops where Mike was an employee to having them work on their vehicles in his own shop. He was even an adjunct for autobody in 2015 for a semester at ChattState.</p>
