    <h2>Why I enjoy reading</h2>
    <p>Whether it be a tv show, YouTube, or movies, most use some form of entertainment to relax and escape reality. My main escapes are books, anime, and movies. Books are a good escape from reality because you're able to immerse yourself into another world that is not your own. I tend to read fantasy, or romantic fantasies (romantasies), alot. Obviously fairies and vampires do not exist in our world, but by reading you can enter a world where they do.    </p>

    <h3> My Current Favorite Genres</h3>
   <p> Currently I enjoy romantasy and psychological thrillers the most. I am still new to romantasy, but I have always enjoyed fantasy or sci-fi books. In middle school, I started reading the Monument 14 trilogy by Emmy Laybourne, then onto Percy Jackson, Maze Runner, Scythe, etc. I believe reading these books started a love for fiction and worlds completely different than our own. Two of the main authors I have read this year are Geneva Lee (romantasy) and Frieda McFadden (psychological thriller). I read other authors in the genres, mainly if their are books available on Kindle Unlimited. Frieda McFadden is my favorite thriller author currently because of the simplicity of her books, they are a good palate cleanser after a heavy book or when I am not in the mood for fantasy. Geneva Lee is my favorite romantasy author due to the good plot lines and likable (or dislikable) characters.   </p>
