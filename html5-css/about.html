            <h2>Where I Purchase Books</h2>
            <p> Everyone has favorite stores they go to for clothes, groceries, and more. The same applies for me when it comes to books, as well. In Trenton, Ga there is a family owned bookstore called Mcbride's. I am not in Trenton much anymore, but when I am I love going in to see what new-to-me books they have. I also enjoy going to 2nd & Charles. 2nd & Charles has more than a surplus of books, they also have figurines (which I have fallen victim to because I collect Kuromi figurines), records, book-themed keychains, bags, and more. Another way I obtain books is through Kindle Unlimited, I just don't own those books and return them once I am done reading them. With Kindle Unlimited, which you don't need a Kindle device for you can just use the app on your phone, it is about $12 a month and you can read as many books as you want that are available on KU. </p>

    <h4>Why These Stores?</h4>
    <p> I enjoy going to Mcbride's because it is a small, family owned business. I like supporting small businesses when I am able, and the workers are always friendly and helpful. 2nd & Charles is a larger chain-type store, but I enjoy going there because of the options from books to themed keychains for a favorite book. They tend to have books from all the years, and if you are looking for a specific book you can't find in-store, they will most likely have it online. I also enjoy the orginization present in-store. I don't get overwhelmed upon entrance and it is easy to navigate their selection. With Kindle Unlimited, I enjoy it because of the variety of books available on there. Some authors also only publish their books on KU. It is also nice to be able to read a book without having to pay for it individually, especially if you read a lot like I do. I am also running out of space on my current bookshelf, so that is another plus! I do have an actual Kindle device, since it is easier on the eyes than my phone is. </p>
